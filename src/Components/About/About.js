            <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
            <p>In 1972, founder of Pro Soccer, Mike Tatikian, at the age of 20 was stepping into his first professional game against the best soccer players in Lebanon. Young, quick, strong and zealous, Mike made it a point to be the best soccer player in the league. Unfortunately, 3 years later Lebanon was going through a civil war and Mike and his wife decided to pack up and leave for Los Angeles, CA in 1975. The bold move to move to Southern California combined with his passion for soccer led Mike to eventually open his first store in 1991.</p>
